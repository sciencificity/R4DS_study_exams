Welcome to my exam prep website. The chapters follow the printed version
of `R for Data Science` which is [online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) as well. I include notes, verbatim sage advice in some cases, as well as my exercise
solutions.

<strong>Assumptions:</strong>

- You have worked through the material in the physical or online book.
- You have attempted the exercises yourself. Learning by practising
is a really great way to get acclimatised to the language.
- You understand that like you, I too am on a journey of learning, and therefore 
will be kind with mistakes you may pick up. 
That being said, I know there's many
ways to tackle problems in R and I never want to put out material that is
fundamentally flawed, so please do let [me](https://twitter.com/sciencificity) know if I have some glaring incorrect content contained within!

<b>Resources I really enjoyed:</b>

- [R for Data Science Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/)
- [R Studio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/)
- [Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers)
